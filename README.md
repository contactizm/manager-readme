#Motivation for this document
I've written this document because I want to be transparent and clear about what you can expect from me, and what I'll expect from you as we work together.  I'll also include some of my particularities, hangups and principles I work by so you have a better understanding of me as a person, and what is important to me.

My intention is to give you a clear roadmap on how to have the best working relationship with me, as fast as possible. 


#My role
At a high level, I'm responsible for the success of our tech team.  I'm responsible for hiring great team members, and retaining you all.  I'm responsible for making sure you have all of the support and context to do amazing work.  I'm also responsible for making sure we have appropriate and productive processes and principles in place that guide the work we do.  The biggest thing I'm here to do though, is support you to do the amazing work you want to do.


#What do I value most?
The thing I value most is forthright communication and collaboration.  There will be times when I don't have answers, when you don't have answers, and when your teammates don't have answers.  We will succeed when we are humble in our interactions with each other, and devoted enough to have challenging conversations.


Sometimes (many times) I won't have the answers or a clue as to what your'e talking about.  Help me out, understand where my gaps in knowledge are and do your best to bring me up to speed.  I often dive into topics and need to get up to speed quickly along the way.


I also tend to approach topics with a very unshaped idea of how to move them along, with some vague sense of what my ideas are, and I depend on our group communication to grok the nuance and move our discussion towards good solutions.  I understand this may be frustrating if your approach to discussion or collaboration is more structured.  If that's the case, please just let me know and I'll try as best I can to modify my approach so we can work more effectively together.


#My Expectations
If you want to discuss anything, I'm at your service.  My preferred method for setting time together is that you ping me in slack to let me know the topic, then just find time on my calendar within the timeframe that works best for you and the topic.  If you have trouble finding time with me, let me know and I'll move things around.

We're all doing the best work we can here, but sometimes we all make mistakes.  I expect you (and definitely me) to make mistakes, but my greatest expectation is that we learn quickly from our mistakes and put in place mechanisms (system mechanisms or mental frameworks)  to stop them happening again. 

I really value flexibility and I imagine you do to.  Flexibility is most possible when we have a great understanding together, when we know our roles and responsibilities, and have great lines of communication.  I'll expect us to value those principles which will enable us to do great work and feel great about doing it.

#1:1s
1:1s are one of the most important parts of our relationship together.  By default, I want to meet with you for 1 hour per week.  The timing for that is up to you, some folks like early morning, some later in the afternoon, some early or late in the week.  1:1s are YOUR time so I will meet with you whenever suits you best.  I totally understand that sometimes you might be in the groove working and not want to meet, or you don't have anything to discuss.  I don't want to be dogmatic about us meeting and I respect your ability to manage time and meetings that are useful to you.  But, that being said, this is a such an important relationship to me that I encourage you to use the time.

I'll create an agenda document for our 1:1s.  My expectation is that you drive agenda topics and have them ready for our 1:1s, and I'll also add agenda items on my mind.  My preference is that we talk about things at a higher level than your current status of what you're working on, for instance if you have questions about strategic direction for the company or tech team, or organizational concerns for how we work together.  It's also an opportunity to coach on some product development principles I really value and will always be trying to improve with our team.


#Personality quirks
I'm a soccer fiend, you'll know that in the first 10 seconds of meeting me.  I also tend to speak a lot in soccer analogies to make clear a point.  If that rubs you the wrong way, just let me know and I'll tone it down (seriously no offense will be taken).

I can tell you that unfairness triggers me a bit.  If I feel like someone isn't being respected, or getting the short end of the stick, I get heated quickly.  I try very hard to maintain and manage a calm and thoughtful approach to these scenarios, but please do be aware that is a tendency of mine.

I will sometimes ask to attend meetings that don't concern me directly.  A lot of times this is because I'm trying to understand more about how our process of working together is going, rather than the content of the meeting itself.  This is not an attempt to micromanage or disrespect your autonomy, I'm just looking to understand our dynamics.  You are 100% welcome to suggest I don't attend if you don't want me to.

  

#Where to focus on your first 90 days?
We're constantly in the process of improving how we onboard new developers to the team.  Right now, we take a hybrid approach of some standard exercises/meetings that all new devs do, and some very custom meetings and lines of exploration for specific developers based on what we're expecting from them.  We're a fast moving company, and our goal is to have devs grok an area of ownership as quickly as possible.

Feedback in the first 90 days about where you should point yourself and if you're getting the right support and context is super important.  After 30 days, I'd totally expect you to be in a comfortable flow with your team and contributing to projects.  At this point you should have formed a solid enough relationship with your product and technical partners, as well as an understanding of how we work, to independently make sure you're taking on lots of responsibility and ownership.  If not, please let me know and we'll correct it together.  Autonomy is so important, but successful autonomous workflows don't just come easy.  They take good understanding of principles and relationships.


#Everything else ...
I'm a complete open book, if I've left anything out of here just ask me or chat.  I'll happily discuss any topic with you.  If I'm not doing my job well enough in your eyes, PLEASE LET ME KNOW.  I crave your feedback so I can do better.
