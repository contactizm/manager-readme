# ReadMe readme
Hello!  This document is meant to give you immediate insight into how I think about work, and hopefully speed up our process becoming fast partners who can move mountains and other large things. üöÄ


# My role
My role is to support and grow the team, understand our long term goals and the idiosyncrasies of our development challenges, empower product developers with all of the information and context to do great work, and help implement systems of operating that guide us to succeed in producing exceptional products.  Throughout our time together, I hope for all of us to grow as professionals, collaborators and product developers.  I‚Äôll learn from you, you will learn from me and you‚Äôll learn from each other.


# What do I value most?
The thing I value most is forthright communication and collaboration.  There will be times when I don't have answers, when you don't have answers, and when your teammates don't have answers.  We will succeed when we are humble in our interactions with each other, and devoted enough to have challenging conversations.


Sometimes (many times) I won't have the answers or a clue as to what you're talking about.  Help me out, understand where my gaps in knowledge are and do your best to bring me up to speed.  I often dive into topics and need to get up to speed quickly along the way.


# My expectations
We're all doing the best work we can here, but sometimes we all make mistakes.  I expect you (and definitely me) to make mistakes, but my greatest expectation is that we learn quickly from our mistakes and put in place mechanisms (system mechanisms or mental frameworks)  to stop them happening again. 

Feedback is the lifeblood of our team.  I will give you constructive and positive feedback as often as I can, and I would like you to do the same - with me and the rest of the team.  Delivering and receiving feedback isn't easy, but we'll do the work to make us all better at this truly important practice.

# Email/slack/phone
### My communication hierarchy is as follows
Emails I‚Äôll typically respond to by the end of the day, although if my response needs to take time to develop, I might just acknowledge that I‚Äôm ‚Äúworking on it‚Äù and will give you a time frame to expect a more thorough response.

Slack is a great way to communicate throughout the day for important but non-urgent topics.  I‚Äôll monitor individual messages at least every hour (I won‚Äôt see any messages during my meetings), and you can expect responses with at most an hour delay, often more quickly.

If something is super urgent, find me and come talk - I don‚Äôt at all mind a tap on the shoulder or stopping in the hallway.  If you can‚Äôt find me and it‚Äôs super urgent, call me.

# 1:1s
I value these meetings as the most important time we‚Äôll spend together.  Many of you will have different things you‚Äôd like to use this time for, and that‚Äôs great.  This time is for YOU.  We will cover career development and professional growth, short/long/medium term tactics, giving feedback both ways for you and me, discussions around how we might optimize our team working together - anything that is useful.

By default, I will want to schedule 45 minutes with each report once a week.  If you ever need to skip this time or would like to reschedule, please do so freely.  I‚Äôd much rather reschedule than skip as I think this is such an important part of our working relationship.

I‚Äôll maintain a shared agenda document, and I‚Äôd like you to drive the agenda topics as much as possible. I‚Äôll also add topics that are on my mind, but remember that this time is really designed for you to use as you‚Äôd like.  We‚Äôll set goals for short, medium and long term horizons and check in on them periodically.

# Scheduling time with me
I structure my time quite heavily.  My availability will always be set on my calendar, typically including time for individual work and exploration that I want to do.  That being said, if you ever want to make time to meet with me, you‚Äôre free to take any space on my calendar that you see available.  You don‚Äôt even have to ask first, if you see it take it (then ping me and let me know what you‚Äôd like to discuss).  If you‚Äôre unable to find space on my calendar quickly enough for your topic, just ping me and let me know and I‚Äôll move things around to make time for you.

You can either bring up my shared company calendar or use my scheduling tool at https://x.ai/calendar/joeybetras


# My own idiosyncrasies
Here‚Äôs the part where I try to be transparent and self aware about how I personally like to operate, so that we‚Äôll be on the same page :)

First of all, I‚Äôm absolutely an open book.  Transparency and directness are my principles, so always feel free to be very open with me.  I‚Äôll talk truthfully about anything and every topic and would love for you to do the same.

During meetings I will put my phone and computer away and give you my full attention.  I‚Äôll expect the same from you please.  If it‚Äôs a long meeting, we can take a short break in the middle to do a phone check or quickly respond to anything that might have come up.  If our discussion requires note-taking on the computer, that‚Äôs fine - I‚Äôm not incredibly rigid about this.  My general rule though is that I want to give you my full attention when we‚Äôre meeting together, and I‚Äôd ask you do the same.

The work we do is challenging and will take all of our expertise in different areas to be successful.  So this means we‚Äôll have discussions where we disagree about things passionately, but will ultimately need to come together and move forward in the same direction.  I value these challenging discussions, but I ask that we be incredibly respectful when we have differences of opinions or understandings.  Veering into personal judgements or attacks will put me off, whether this happens with me personally or amongst yourselves.  I ask that we please remember we are here to solve difficult problems together and maintaining respect, empathy and compassion is vital to our success.


# Everything else ...
If I've left anything out of here just ask me.  I'll happily discuss any topic with you.  If I'm not doing my job well enough in your eyes, PLEASE LET ME KNOW.  I crave your feedback so I can do better.
